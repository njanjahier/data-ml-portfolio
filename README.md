## 🧩 Problem

As someone building skills in **data analysis and machine learning**, I needed a way to:

- present my projects in one central place,
- make the portfolio easy to share with recruiters and collaborators,
- ensure the website looks professional when shared on social media (LinkedIn, GitHub, email),
- follow modern web standards (SEO, performance, deployment),
- keep the setup simple and scalable for future projects.

A plain GitHub repository list was not enough — I wanted a **production-ready portfolio website**.

## 💡 Solution

I built a **modern portfolio website** using **Next.js and TypeScript**, deployed on **Vercel**, with a strong focus on **presentation, SEO, and usability**.

The solution includes:

### 🚀 Frontend & Structure
- **Next.js (React + TypeScript)** for a clean and scalable frontend
- Component-based architecture for easy future expansion
- Simple and readable codebase

### 📈 SEO & Social Sharing
- **SEO metadata** (title, description) for better search engine visibility
- **Open Graph tags** so shared links show a proper preview image, title, and description
- **Favicon** for a polished browser experience

This ensures the portfolio looks professional when shared via LinkedIn, email, or messaging apps.

### 🌍 Deployment
- **Deployed on Vercel**
- Automatic redeployment on every GitHub commit
- Fast performance and HTTPS by default
